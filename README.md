# Taskmanager

This was my first attempt at combining MySQL and PHP to create a simple "To-do list" web project.

## Getting Started

<dl>
  <u><dt>Step One</dt></u>
  <dd>- Ensure your device has access to a server which supports PHP scripts (WAMP, XAMP, etc).</dd>
  <u><dt>Step Two</dt></u>
  <dd>-Ensure the aforementioned server is running (In WAMP, the server icon should be displayed as green). </dd>
   <u><dt>Step Three</dt></u>
  <dd>- Click on this link: to access the "To-do list" project.</dd>
  <u><dt>Step Four</dt></u>
  <dd>-Enter your desired task and task information into the entry fields provided:
  	<li>Task Name</li>
  	<li>Task Description</li>
    <li>Due-date/Deadline</li>
    .
   </dd>
   <u><dt>Step Five</dt></u>
  <dd>- Click the "Save" button to store/save your task.</dd>
  <u><dt>Step Six</dt></u>
  <dd>- Click the "Edit" button to edit your task name or description.</dd>
  <u><dt>Step Seven</dt></u>
  <dd>- Click the "Delete" button to delete your task.</dd>
</dl>
